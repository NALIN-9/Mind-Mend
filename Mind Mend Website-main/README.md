# Mind Mend â€“ A Website Related to Mental Health Awareness

**Mind Mend** is a full-stack project dedicated to mental health. The platform provides resources, educational content, and a supportive community for individuals seeking guidance, awareness, and encouragement in their mental health journey.  

By building **Mind Mend**, we aim to break the stigma around mental health, encourage open conversations, and provide a safe space for individuals to learn, share experiences, and access resources to support their mental well-being.  

Our website seeks to empower visitors to prioritize their mental health and normalize discussions around mental well-being. We believe that providing accurate information and fostering a compassionate community contributes to a society where mental health is given the same importance as physical health.
